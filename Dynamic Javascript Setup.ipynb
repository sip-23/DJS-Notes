    "# Understanding Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction: Cornerstone of creating efficient and manageable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction\n",
    "- is about managing the complexity of systems by focusing on the high-level operations while hiding the details of their implementation. \n",
    "    - It's akin to knowing how to drive a car without needing to understand the intricacies of how the engine works. \n",
    "- In programming, abstraction allows us to use \n",
    "    - functions, \n",
    "    - variables, and \n",
    "    - other constructs without delving into their underlying details every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is a technique for managing complexity in software systems. \n",
    "- It allows developers to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts. Does it by:\n",
    "    - Focusing on the essential features of a component while \n",
    "    - Ignoring its complex details, \n",
    "- It helps in reducing complexity and making the software easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "- It is simplification\n",
    "    - hiding of complex details and presenting of a simple interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Abstraction Important?\n",
    "- Simplifies Complex Systems: \n",
    "    - By breaking down a system into manageable parts, abstraction makes it easier to focus on what each part does, rather than how it does it.\n",
    "- Reduces Code Complexity: \n",
    "    - It helps in hiding the detailed implementation of features, making the code cleaner and more understandable.\n",
    "- Enhances Code Reusability: \n",
    "    - Abstracted components can be reused in different parts of a software system or even in different projects, saving time and effort.\n",
    "- Improves Software Design: \n",
    "    - Good abstraction facilitates better software design, making it easier to modify and extend the software without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Abstraction in Everyday Life\n",
    "- Mathematics: Concepts like (E = mc^2) abstract complex relationships into comprehensible expressions.\n",
    "- Reading: Our ability to recognize words without spelling them out letter by letter is a form of abstraction, simplifying the process of reading.\n",
    "- Chunking: This psychological phenomenon demonstrates how we group information into manageable units, facilitating understanding and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Abstraction in Programming\n",
    "Focus on how to apply abstraction in building our programming projects. This involves:\n",
    "- Recognizing Patterns: Identifying common patterns that can be abstracted into functions or modules.\n",
    "- Building Reusable Components: Creating components that can be used across different parts of a project or even in different projects.\n",
    "- Simplifying Complexity: Using abstraction to simplify complex operations into more manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points (Video):\n",
    "**How to Design Software**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction in Practice**: \n",
    "- From basic principles to\n",
    "    - Transition from understanding individual concepts\n",
    "- How software is designed, \n",
    "    - see how to combine learned principles into **composable units**.\n",
    "    - to applying them in designing complex software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Managing Complexity**: \n",
    "- Complexity in software development lies in managing the space between **low-level elements/operations**, below the software level/system as a whole. \n",
    "- Effective abstraction helps in bridging this gap by creating manageable layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Application**:\n",
    "- Focus on individual concepts to help you building real-world applications. \n",
    "    - This dual approach helps in solidifying your understanding of JavaScript and programming fundamentals through practical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Importance of Fundamentals**: \n",
    "- Grasp the fundamentals is crucial before delving into abstraction.\n",
    "- How to approach and have a solid low-level foundation for abstraction:\n",
    "    - You can explain the Event Loop and why Promise callbacks run before setTimeout callbacks.\n",
    "    - You can predict the value of this in any given function without running the code.\n",
    "    - You can implement data privacy and function factories using closures.\n",
    "    - You can create an inheritance chain without the class keyword.\n",
    "    - You can convert between callbacks, promises, and async/await fluently.\n",
    "    - You can debug a \"cannot read property X of undefined\" error by understanding the prototype chain.\n",
    "- How to Approach These High-Level Concepts for abstraction:\n",
    "    - Build a Project: The best way to learn these is to build a medium-sized project (e.g., a todo app is fine, but try something more complex like a small e-commerce site or a social media post feed).\n",
    "    - Use a Framework: Choose React (most popular, great ecosystem) or Vue (excellent documentation, very approachable) and build with it.\n",
    "    - Encounter Problems: You will run into state management problems—this is when you learn Redux or Zustand. You will run into prop drilling—this is when you learn the Context API.\n",
    "    - Add Tooling: Set up ESLint and Prettier. Use Vite to create your project. Later, add TypeScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low-level Foundations: Gives you the power to understand JavaScript.\n",
    "- Move from thinking: \"this line runs, then that line runs\"\n",
    "- To thinking: Environment where it runs.\n",
    "    - **JavaScript Engine** (e.g., V8) - Understand it has a:\n",

    "                - Syntactic sugar built on top of promises. \n",
    "                - Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code. \n",
    "                - Understand that `await` keyword simply pauses the execution of the `async` function, not the whole program.\n",
    "            - What to practice:\n",
    "                - Convert a callback-based function (like `fs.readFile`) into a promise-based one.\n",
    "                - Chain multiple promises together to perform sequential async operations.\n",
    "                - Use `async/await` to rewrite promise chains for cleaner syntax.\n",

    "### Practical Applications of Abstraction\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Creating a unique identifier (UUID) in JavaScript. \n",
    "    - At its core, the process involves complex operations,\n",
    "        - Through abstraction, we encapsulate this complexity into a single function. \n",
    "        - This function, `createUniqueID()`, can then be used without needing to understand its internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual Functions Abstraction in Layers\n",
    "- From UUIDs to Employees:\n",
    "    - Extend our abstraction example to creating employees in a system. \n",
    "        - By abstracting the process, `createUniqueID()`, into a `createEmployee()` function, we define what information is essential and hide the rest.\n",
    "        - This method not only makes the code cleaner but also ensures consistency across the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "System-Wide Abstraction\n",
    "- Abstract at the system level allows defining entities like colleagues or event attendees in terms of their relationships and interactions. \n",
    "    - This higher level of abstraction allows us to model complex systems in a way that is intuitive and easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks of Over-Abstraction\n",
    "- Abstraction is powerful, it's important to use it judiciously. \n",
    "- Over-abstraction can lead to code that is difficult to understand or modify, \n",
    "    - as the connections between the abstracted concepts become too tenuous or obscured. \n",
    "- Finding the right balance is key to effective software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different programming paradigms that leverage abstraction,\n",
    "- **Procedural Programming**: Building on what we've been doing, focusing on sequences of actions or steps.\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulating data and operations into objects, a common approach for managing complexity in large applications.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming**: Emphasizing the use of functions as the primary building blocks of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each paradigm offers a unique approach to abstraction, with its own set of advantages and potential pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction Significance\n",
    "- Abstraction: Cognitive process, which simplify complex things into more manageable \"things\" or concepts.\n",
    "    - How one can instinctively recognise an object without examining every part in detail\n",
    "- In programming, effective software development requires us to abstract our code into components with specific properties and functionalities.\n",
    "    - helps manage complexity by focusing on the essence of what these components do, rather than how they do it.\n",
    "    - enables developers to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable ones, constructing components that solve these smaller issues and then combining them into a complete application. \n",
    "    - helps us structure our code according to our built-in human ability to think, reason and interact with complex things without having to understand all the parts that make a thing.\n",
    "- Abstraction and the brain:\n",
    "    - The brains automatically take a group of related low-level complex parts and group them into simpler “things”,\n",
    "    - The brain instinctively “knows” what something is without having to inspect every element it is made from in detail until you can conclude, “I think this is maybe a door”.\n",
    "    - The ability for the brain to instinctively think and talk about “objects”, whether in programming or real life.\n",
    "- As a programmer: The ability to meaningfully abstract code is what separates bad software developers from good software developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of Abstraction in Software Design\n",
    "Abstraction is about\n",
    "- simplification; \n",
    "- identifying and focusing on the essential characteristics of a component while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is critical in creating **scalable** and **maintainable software**. \n",
    "- The ability to abstract effectively separates great developers from the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **SOLID Principles**\n",
    "Abstraction allows developers to manage complexity by hiding the detailed implementation of a feature, making the code more flexible, maintainable, and reusable. \n",
    "- Explore how to create effective abstractions in JavaScript by applying the SOLID principles. \n",
    "    - SOLID is a set of guidelines for object-oriented programming that promotes good software design and architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID stands for: \n",
    "- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), \n",
    "- Open-Closed Principle (OCP), \n",
    "- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), \n",
    "- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), \n",
    "- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these principles provide a framework for building software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes a good Abstraction\n",
    "- Through guidelines, \n",
    "    - Three different paradigms that have their own opinion on how abstraction should be done in software.\n",
    "- In JavaScript, Abstraction can be implemented using the **SOLID principles**, which are a \n",
    "    - set of guidelines for object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. \n",
    "- To apply SRP in JavaScript,\n",
    "    - Create separate modules or classes that handle specific tasks or responsibilities. \n",
    "    - Each module or class should be responsible for a single functionality or feature, and should not be coupled with other functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. \n",
    "- In JavaScript,\n",
    "    - Apply this principle by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods or properties. \n",
    "        - Concrete classes can then inherit from these abstract classes or interfaces and implement their methods. \n",
    "            - This way, you can add new functionalities without modifying existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - implement LSP by ensuring that subclasses inherit all the properties and methods of their superclass, and do not alter their behaviour in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that a client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - Apply ISP by creating small, focused interfaces that define only the methods that a client needs. \n",
    "        - This way, you can avoid creating large, bloated interfaces that are difficult to maintain and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. \n",
    "    - Instead, both should depend on abstractions. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - Implement DIP by using dependency injection, which allows you to pass dependencies to a module or class rather than creating them inside. \n",
    "        - This way, you can decouple modules and make them more reusable and testable."

    "\n",
    "Procedural Implementation: Implement the app functionality, including adding and displaying elements procedurally.\n",
    "- Functions are treated as procedures.\n",
    "- Actions are performed by calling a series of functions or procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural programming is about writing a list of instructions that tell the computer what to do step by step. It heavily relies on procedures (also known as routines or functions) that operate on data. The data and the functions that operate on that data are separate.\n",

    "Structured programming imposes discipline on **direct** transfer of control.\n",
    "- No longer allowed to go to a direct line of code by instruction\n",
    "- No longer allowed to directly control the flow of data \n",

    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "- Procedures/Functions: Blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are the main building blocks.\n",
    "- Top-Down Design: The problem is broken down into a series of smaller, manageable sub-problems (procedures).\n",
    "- Data Separation: Data is typically stored in variables and data structures (arrays, structs) that are passed around between functions.\n",
    "- Emphasis on: The order of execution and the logic of the steps.\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:\n",
    "Transitioning to OOP\n",
    "- Refactor the application to use an object-oriented style.\n",
    "- Its the idea of having the functions as constructors for the class / Object.\n",
    "    - Use general functions to generate **data structures** \n",
    "- Shift to an OOP approach using **object literals** and **factory functions** to manage tasks.\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to encapsulate HTML Elements within objects, allowing for more organized and manageable code.\n",
    " \n",
    "What is OOP\n",
    "- Focuses on creating objects that encapsulate both data and functions that operate on that data.\n",
    "- OOP in JavaScript will be demonstrated using **object literals and factory functions**, avoiding classes to simplify the concept.\n",
    "- OOP organizes software design around objects and classes rather than functions and logic. An object is a bundle of related data (attributes) and behavior (methods). The data and the functions that operate on that data are bundled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on **indirect** transfer of control.\n",
    "- No longer allowed to have the control that PP has.\n",
    "- removes the separation between data and behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP create things to represent real life entities (encapsulation)\n",
    "- Task\n",
    "    - Has specific data\n",
    "    - Can do speacific things\n",
    "- List \n",
    "    - that contains all the tasks data\n",
    "    - Can do specific things\n",
    "- Control: control what information is shown in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you cant go and change things within it. The item itself decides what it wants you to do.\n",
    "- It give you interfaces (button), which then allow you to then interact with each other and classes cannot interect with other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts (The Four Pillars):\n",
    "- `Encapsulation`: Bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). Internal state is often hidden (\"private\"), and interaction happens through a public interface.\n",
    "- `Abstraction`: Exposing only essential features and hiding complex implementation details. (e.g., You know a Car has a start() method, but you don't need to know about the ignition system).\n",
    "- `Inheritance`: Allowing a new class (child) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (parent). This promotes code reusability and establishes \"is-a\" relationships.\n",
    "- `Polymorphism`: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. A method call will behave differently based on the object that is acting. (e.g., Shape class with a draw() method; Circle.draw() and Square.draw() do different things).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Literals and Factory Functions\n",
    "- Object literals are a straightforward way to create objects.\n",
    "- Factory functions are functions that return new objects. \n",
    "    - These can be used to create multiple instances of similar objects, making them ideal for tasks in our to-do list application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts in OOP\n",
    "- Classes vs. Factory Functions: While JavaScript supports classes, focus on **factory functions** for simplicity. \n",
    "    - Factory functions provide a more straightforward approach to creating objects without the complexity of classes.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Demonstrated by grouping related data and functions together into objects, making the code cleaner and more modular.\n",
    " \n",
    "Advantages of OOP\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Allows for bundling data with methods that operate on that data.\n",
    "- Reusability: Through the use of objects, code can be reused, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "- Scalability: OOP makes it easier to scale and manage larger applications by breaking down complex problems into manageable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The OOP paradym dying down: Used to be the main mode\n",
    "- Recendly code became more concurrent and decentralised\n",
    "    - Software used to be close to where the data is.\n",
    "    - Install it in the computer and it would live there.\n",
    "    - Now we have social media accounts through the browser and you could also open it through you cellphone, computer, tablet, different locations and still have multiple tabs of it open at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Old way of building a large application: Monolith.\n",
    "- The Monolith: Everything\n",

    "    - photo storage, \n",
    "    - messaging, \n",

    "        - Is built as a - single,  giant,  interconnected program. \n",
    "        - It runs as one process on a server.\n",
    "- Problem: If one small part (e.g., the password reset feature) has a bug that crashes the program, the entire application goes down.\n",
    "- Problem: To scale because photos are using too much storage, you have to scale the entire application, even the parts that don't need it.\n",
    "- Problem: Every team of developers works on the same codebase, leading to complicated coordination and a high risk of breaking someone else's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microservices are the architectural antithesis of this. \n",
    "- Instead of one giant application, you build many small, independent services that work together.\n",
    "- Microservices are decentralized, meaning authority and control are spread out across the services rather than being held by one central component.  \n",

    "|--------|----------------|------------------------------|\n",
    "|Data Decentralization (Data Sovereignty)|\tThis is the most important form of decentralization. Each service owns and manages its own private database. Other services cannot access this database directly. They can only ask the service for data via its API.|\tThe \"Photo Service\" has its own database (e.g., AWS S3) where it stores the actual image files and their metadata (filename, upload time, etc.). The \"User Profile Service\" cannot directly read from the photo database. To get a user's photos, it must make a request to the Photo Service's API.|\n",
    "|Technology Decentralization |\tEach service can be written in a different programming language, use a different framework, and use the type of database that is best suited for its specific job.|\tThe \"Identity Service\" might be written in Java with a strong security framework and use a relational SQL database (like PostgreSQL) for strict data integrity of user credentials.  The \"Analytics Service\" might be written in Python for data science and use a columnar database (like Cassandra) optimized for fast writes and large queries. |\n",
    "|Decision-Making Decentralization|\tDevelopment teams are organized around services (\"You own the Identity service\"). They can make decisions independently—choosing their own tools, deployment schedules, and development methodologies—as long as they adhere to the shared API contracts.|\tThe Identity team can upgrade their library without needing to check with the Photo team. This enables teams to move much faster and innovate independently.|\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microservices Run Concurrently, meaning these decentralized services operate and communicate in real-time.\n",

    "|Aspect|\tWhat it Means|\tExample (Checking Your Identity)|\n",
    "|------|-----------------|----------------------------------|\n",
    "|Independent Execution|\tEach service runs in its own process. They can be on the same physical server or, more commonly, spread across thousands of servers (often virtual machines or containers) in a cloud environment. |\tThe \"Web Server\" (itself a service) runs separately from the \"Identity Service\", which runs separately from the \"Photo Service\".|\n",
    "|Network Communication|\tSince they are separate processes, they talk to each other over a network using lightweight protocols (usually HTTP/REST or gRPC). This is often called \"inter-process communication (IPC)\".|\t1. You try to access your photos.\n",
    "2. The \"Web Server\" receives your request and sees you need to be authenticated.\n",
    "3. It concurrently makes a network call to the \"Identity Service\" saying, \"Is this user's token valid?\"\n",
    "4. It waits for a response before proceeding.|\n",
    "|Handling Many Requests|\tEach service is designed to handle many requests at the same time. A single instance of the Photo Service might be serving download requests to thousands of users simultaneously.|\tThe \"Photo Service\" can have multiple copies (or replicas) running behind a load balancer. When millions of users request their photos, the load balancer distributes these requests across all the available replicas, allowing the work to be done concurrently and at a massive scale.|\n",
    "|Resilience Through Concurrency|\tThe failure of one service does not have to mean the failure of others. The system is designed to handle these failures gracefully (e.g., using timeouts and fallbacks).|\tIf the \"Identity Service\" is slow or crashes, the \"Web Server\" should \"time out\" after a few seconds and return a helpful error message like \"Authentication service unavailable,\" instead of freezing forever. The rest of the system (e.g., services not needing auth) remains up.|\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scenario: You open the Instagram app and look at your profile page.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Request: The app (the client) sends a request: \"Get the profile page data for user @tom.\"\n",
    "2. API Gateway: The request hits an API Gateway (a traffic cop). It routes the request to the \"Profile Page Service\".\n",
    "3. Orchestration (Concurrency): The Profile Page Service doesn't have the data itself. It orchestrates by making multiple concurrent network calls to other services:\n",
    "    - It calls the \"Identity Service\": \"Confirm the requesting user has permission to view this profile.\" (This happens in the background).\n",
    "    - It calls the \"User Service\": \"Get the basic profile info for @tom (name, bio, etc.).\"\n",
    "    - It calls the \"Photo Service\": \"Get the URLs for the last 12 photos uploaded by @tom.\"\n",
    "    - It calls the \"Follower Service\": \"Get the count of how many people follow @tom.\"\n",
    "4. Decentralized Data Access: Each of these services:\n",
    "    - Owns its data: The User Service has its own \"User\" database. The Photo Service has its own \"Photo\" storage.\n",
    "    - Processes the request: They perform their specific logic and return only the necessary data (e.g., JSON) to the Profile Page Service.\n",
    "5. Response: The Profile Page Service aggregates all the JSON responses it received, constructs the final profile page data, and sends it back to your phone. Your app then renders it.\n",

    "OOP has fallen because of **decentralisation** and **concurrency** and **Parallel**.\n",
    "- System with OOP overhead would be idle\n",
    "- But with Functional programming, Things can still happen while you wait for data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Functional Programming (FP)**\n",
    "FP treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes what to solve rather than how to solve it (declarative style).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.\n",
    "- Cannot reassign things\n",
    "- It takes thing and creates new things\n",
    "- kKeping Data and behaviour separate, but It removes the ability to mutate/change data\n",
    "- Its says dont create abstractions where themselves are mutable (dont create objects where values can change with OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "- `Pure Functions`: Functions that, given the same input, will always return the same output and have no side effects (e.g., no modifying global variables, no printing to console).\n",
    "- `Immutability`: Data is immutable; it cannot be changed after it's created. Instead of changing existing data, you create new data.\n",
    "- `First-Class and Higher-Order Functions`: Functions are treated like any other variable. They can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values, and assigned to variables. A function that takes another function as an argument is a higher-order function (e.g., map, filter, reduce).\n",
    "- `Avoidance of Side Effects`: A side effect is any change outside the function's scope (modifying a global variable, writing to a file, etc.). FP strives to minimize these.\n",
    "- `Recursion`: Used heavily for iteration and control flow, as opposed to traditional loops which often require state change (e.g., incrementing a counter).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison and Practical Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural vs. Object-Oriented:\n",
    "- Procedural programming can be simpler and more straightforward for linear processes.\n",
    "- OOP is more suitable for complex applications with lots of interconnected parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented vs. Functional:\n",
    "- OOP is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.\n",
    "- Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of functions without side effects.\n",
    "    -  Main weakness of functional programming is the flip side of its main strength.\n",
    "        - Problems arise when: the system to be built must maintain state of some kind.\n",
    "    - Writing functional code is often backwards and can feel more like solving puzzles than like explaining a process to the computer.\n",
    "        -  its like trying to Translate the steps without mutable state.\n",

    "# OOP - Object Orientated programming\n",
    "Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism within JavaScript.\n",
    "- These principles stand as fundamental pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP), and their application in JavaScript offers a rich landscape for learning and exploration.\n",
    "    - Encapsulation, think about how JavaScript objects bundle data and functions together. \n",
    "    - Inheritance, consider how objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. \n",
    "    - Polymorphism, reflect on how different objects can be treated as instances of a single type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think critically about how the concepts being explained could be applied to your own projects or problems you're interested in solving.\n",
    "- Focus on the \"why\" and \"how\" of the concepts illustrated by the project code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Encapsulation**\n",
    "In OOP, encapsulation is central to creating abstractions.\n",
    "- Abstractions help in solving specific programming problems by allowing us to:\n",
    "    - bundle data (**Attributes | Properties**) and methods (**Functions | Methods**) that operate on the data into a single unit (**object**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Car\n",
    "- Properties:\n",
    "    - Make\n",
    "    - Model\n",
    "    - Colour\n",
    "- Methods:\n",
    "    - Start()\n",
    "    - Move()\n",
    "    - Stop()\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Local Storage\n",
    "- Propeties:\n",
    "    - length\n",
    "- Methods:\n",
    "    - setItem()\n",
    "    - removeitem()\n",
    "    - getItem\n",
    "\n",
    "`Encapsulation` is at the heart of OOP since it allows **grouping of related data and behaviour behind an abstracted interface (Object)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts, the others being:\n",
    "- Inheritance, \n",
    "    - Mechanism to help eliminate redundant code\n",
    "        - HTML Elements like: `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<checkbox>`\n",
    "            - They have Propeties:\n",
    "                - hidden\n",
    "                - innerHTML\n",
    "            - They have Methods:\n",
    "                - click()\n",
    "                - focus()\n",
    "    - Instead of defining all of these Propeties and methods for each HTML element, define them once in an Object (HTMLElements) and help other Objects inherit this properties and methods\n",
    "- Polymorphism\n",
    "    - Tecniques that helps Removes long `if-else`, or `switch-case` statements.\n",
    "- Abstraction.\n",
    "    - Hiding of complexity: Hide some properties and Methods from the outside\n",
    "        - This makes interface of object more simple\n",
    "        - Helps reduce impact of change (No of the changes to the hidden properties will affect the rest of the application)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the **bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within one unit**, and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mindset:\n",
    "- a **class based in Java** \n",
    "- a **prototype based in JavaScript**\n",
    "    - This means that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside, only exposing a controlled interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Achieve Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Using Classes: Most OOP languages use classes to encapsulate data and methods. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects (instances).\n",
    "- Access Modifiers: Keywords like `private`, `protected`, and `public` in languages such as Java and C++ control access to the object's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript, being a prototype-based language, has a slightly different approach to OOP.\n",
    "- It is a `syntactical sugar` over its existing prototype-based inheritance.\n",
    "    - making changes or additions to the syntax of a language that don't add new features but make things easier to write or read.\n",
    "    - meaning, classes provide a clearer and more straightforward way to set up inheritance.\n",
    "        - they make the code look cleaner and more like how other programming languages handle object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "        - but underneath, JavaScript still uses its original prototype-based system to make it all work.\n",
    "- Objects inherit features and properties from one another through a system known as \"prototype-based inheritance.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Before: **JavaScript used prototypes directly for inheritance.**\n",
    "- This means that objects can have a prototype object, which they can inherit properties and methods from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation in web development involves creating components with private internal states that can only be interacted with through a public interface.\n",
    "- This ensures the component's internal workings are hidden, safeguarding from external changes unless through specified methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating Components with Private States\n",
    "    - Encapsulation in web components involves **defining properties and methods that are only accessible within the component**. \n",
    "    - This can be achieved using \n",
    "        - `closures`\n",
    "            - Wraps the Object in a function that creates the Action: Counter. see below\n",
    "        - `classes`,\n",
    "        - `Web Components standards` which use the **Shadow DOM**\n",
    "2. Web Components and Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Web Components provide a standard way to create encapsulated, reusable custom elements. \n",
    "    - These components encapsulate their \n",
    "        - HTML structure, \n",
    "        - CSS styles, and \n",
    "        - JavaScript functionality, \n",
    "            - preventing external interference and clashes with other parts of a web application.\n",
    "3. Using Classes for Encapsulation\n",
    "    - JavaScript classes offer a more traditional OOP approach to encapsulation. \n",
    "    - By using classes, developers can define private properties and methods that are not accessible from outside the class instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation\n",
    "- Is the bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (object). \n",
    "- It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental modification of data.\n",
    "- This concept helps in maintaining code by:\n",
    "    - Hiding the internal state: Only necessary information is exposed, reducing complexity.\n",
    "    - Reducing interdependencies: Changes in one part of the system minimally affect others."

    "More dynamic and reusable way of building web components. \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is closely related to the concept of **polymorphism**\n",
    "- It allows us to design components that can accept different content or elements at specific points within their structure, making them highly flexible and adaptable to various use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The Problem with Over-Abstraction**\n",
    "Polymorphism and its relevance to web component development. \n",
    "- Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. \n",
    "    - This concept helps us create a more general-purpose, reusable code. \n",
    "- **There's a danger in over-abstraction**\n",
    "    - Overly generic components can lead to complex conditional logic, making the code harder to understand and maintain.\n",
    "- **Find a balance**\n",
    "    - Build components that are reusable across different parts of your application without making them so abstract that they lose their specificity. \n",
    "    - The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the first principle in SOLID, advises that a class or component should have only one reason to change.     - This principle guides us in avoiding the pitfalls of over-abstraction by focusing on the specific responsibility of each component.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Introducing Component Slots**\n",
    "- Component slots come into play as a solution to the challenge of maintaining component reusability without falling into the trap of over-abstraction.\n",
    "- Slots allow us to define placeholders within a component that can be filled with custom content when the component is used, rather than hardcoding all possible variations within the component itself.\n"

    "Definition: \n",
    "- Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).\n",
    "    - it allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.\n",
    "- It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. \n",
    "- It allows for creating abstractions that scale well.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Type of polymorphism**\n",
    "- Ad Hoc Polymorphism: Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.\n",
    "- Parametric Polymorphism: Allows a function or a data type to be written generically, so it can handle values uniformly without depending on their type.\n",
    "- Subtype Polymorphism (or Inclusion Polymorphism): Allows a function to be written to take objects of a superclass type, but also work with objects of any subclass types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples in Programming:\n",
    "- Function Overloading: The same function name can perform different tasks based on input parameters.\n",
    "- Operator Overloading: The same operator behaves differently based on operands.\n",
    "- Interface Implementation: Different classes can implement the same interface in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best prectices\n",
    "\n",
    "Design for Interface, not Implementation: \n",
    "- Focus on designing interfaces that abstract the underlying implementations. \n",
    "- This promotes loose coupling and high cohesion in software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Polymorphic Components Thoroughly: \n",
    "- Ensure thorough testing of polymorphic components, as their behaviour might change depending on the runtime object they operate on.\n",

    "### **Creating a State Store**\n",
    "1. Define the Initial State: \n",
    "    - Step 1 is defining the initial state of your application. \n",
    "        - This could be anything from a simple numeric value to a more complex object representing multiple aspects of your app's state.\n",
    "2. Create Update Functions: \n",
    "    - These functions are responsible for updating the state based on specific actions. \n",
    "        - In functional programming, \n",
    "            - Dont directly modifying the original state, \n",
    "            - Create a new state with the changes applied. \n",
    "                - This approach avoids side effects and maintains immutability.\n",

    "        - Updating it or \n",
    "        - Subscribing to changes\n",
    "4. Subscribing to the Store: \n",
    "    - This involves creating a mechanism where parts of your application can \"listen\" to changes in the store.\n",
    "    - When the state changes, the store notifies all subscribers of the new state, allowing them to react accordingly.\n",
    "5. Middleware: In more advanced scenarios, you might introduce middleware into your store. \n",

    "\n",
    "##### **What is Redux**\n",
    "- It is a library that helps manage the state of your application. \n",
    "    - The state refers to the data or the current conditions of your app at any given time. \n",
    "- Redux ensures that your state changes are predictable and easy to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts of Redux:\n",
    "- Stores: A store holds the whole state tree of your application. There can only be a single store in a Redux application \n",
    "- Actions: Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. \n",
    "- Reducers: Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **How they work together to manage state in your applications:**\n",
    "- It revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow, meaning that:\n",
    "    - all data in the application follows the same lifecycle pattern, \n",
    "        - making the logic of your app more predictable and easier to understand. \n",
    "- This process involves three main steps:\n",
    "    1. **Dispatching an Action**: \n",
    "        - An action is dispatched when you want to change the state. \n",
    "        - This action describes what happened, but doesn't describe how the application's state changes.\n",
    "    2. **Handling Actions with Reducers**: \n",
    "        - A reducer is a function that determines how the state should change in response to an action. \n",
    "            - Reducers are pure functions, meaning: \n",
    "                - they should not have any side-effects or mutate the state directly; instead, \n",
    "                - they return a new state object based on the incoming action.\n",
    "    3. **Subscribing to the Store**: \n",
    "        - Components can subscribe to the store, so they can be updated when the state changes. \n",
    "            - When the state is updated, the store notifies all subscribed components, prompting them to re-render with the new state.\n",

    "    - The Store: It's a central place where the application's state lives. \n",
    "        - The store exposes a method to get the current state (getState), subscribe to changes (subscribe), and dispatch actions (dispatch).\n",
    "    - Actions: These are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. \n",
    "        - Actions have a type property that indicates the kind of action being performed. \n",

    "##### **Building the UI Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting with Components: \n",
    "- Components are the building blocks of our UI. However, managing components in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can get unwieldy due to large codebases and repetition. By abstracting component creation, we can focus on the essentials.\n",
    "2. Creating Abstractions: \n",
    "- We introduce a utility function, createComponent, that simplifies component creation. This function encapsulates common tasks like attaching shadow DOM, adding event listeners, and connecting components to a global state (if necessary).\n",
    "3. Example Implementation: \n",
    "- A simple example is demonstrated where a component is created using the createComponent utility. This approach abstracts away the repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus on defining the component's behaviour and presentation.\n",
    "4. Declarative UI Updates: \n",
    "- A key goal of our framework is to enable declarative updates to the UI. This means describing what the UI should look like for a given state, without worrying about how to transition the UI from one state to another. This approach is central to functional programming and modern UI frameworks.\n",
    "5. Advantages of Our Approach: \n",
    "- By adopting immutability, pure functions, and separation of data from behaviour, our framework reduces complexity and makes the codebase more manageable. It aligns with functional programming principles, leading to more predictable and easier-to-debug code.\n"

    "### **Declarative DOM Updates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Frameworks like React have introduced a more efficient way of updating the Document Object Model (DOM) through **declarative updates**. \n",
    "- This approach simplifies the process of changing the user interface in response to data changes. \n",
    "- The essence of declarative DOM updates lies in specifying what the UI should look like for a given state, without detailing the step-by-step process of achieving that appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "- Functional Approach: \n",
    "    - This methodology applies functional programming principles to UI development. \n",
    "    - It emphasizes immutability, purity, and unidirectional data flow, ensuring that the UI is a direct reflection of the application state.\n",
    "- Unidirectional Data Flow: \n",
    "    - In this model, data follows a single path, making state management predictable and debugging simpler. \n",
    "    - The application's state is the single source of truth, dictating the UI's appearance through transformations.\n",
    "- Declarative vs. Imperative: \n",
    "    - Imperative programming tells the computer how to perform tasks step by step.4\n",
    "    - Declarative programming tells the computer what you want, letting the framework handle the specifics. \n",
    "        - This shift reduces the complexity of UI development.\n",
    "- Virtual DOM and React: \n",
    "    - React introduced the virtual DOM concept, which is an abstraction layer that optimizes DOM updates. \n",
    "    - When the application state changes, React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one, updating only the parts of the actual DOM that changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Declarative DOM Updates\n",
    "- Simplified Debugging: \n",
    "    - With a clear relationship between state and UI, tracking down bugs becomes more straightforward.\n",
    "- Improved Performance: \n",
    "    - By minimizing direct DOM manipulations and only updating changed elements, declarative updates enhance web application performance.\n",
    "- Enhanced Readability and Maintenance: \n",
    "    - This approach leads to more readable code, as the focus is on what the application should do rather than how to do it. \n",
    "    - This readability significantly aids in long-term maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "- State Management Complexity: \n",
    "    - While declarative DOM updates simplify UI changes, managing application state, especially in large applications, can become complex. Solutions like Redux or React's Context API help manage global state efficiently.\n",
    "- Learning Curve: \n",
    "    - Understanding the underlying concepts of frameworks like React, including the virtual DOM, JSX, and component lifecycle methods, can be challenging for beginners. However, these concepts become more intuitive with practice and exposure.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Common features across frameworks** include:\n",
    "- Component-based architecture – Encapsulation of logic and UI\n",
    "- Declarative rendering – Simplified UI updates\n",
    "- Reactivity – Automatic view updates when data changes\n",
    "- State management – Controlled, testable application state\n",
    "- Encapsulation – Modular, reusable, and testable units\n",
    "- Store pattern (optional) – Centralized global state\n",
    "- Dependency injection (optional) – Flexible service provision\n",
    "\n",
    "### Component-Based Architecture\n",
    "Frameworks support **encapsulated components** — reusable blocks of UI that include logic, structure, and styling. \n",
    "- Components are:\n",
    "    - Testable in isolation\n",
    "    - Easy to reuse\n",
    "    - Maintainable and modular\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "    - React uses functions and JSX.\n",
    "    - Vue uses single-file .vue components.\n",
    "    - Angular uses TypeScript classes and decorators.\n",
    "    - Svelte uses .svelte files that compile to minimal JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering Systems\n",
    "Rendering is the process of converting data into UI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Frameworks offer:\n",
    "- **Declarative rendering**: which is easier to reason about vs imperative DOM updates.\n",
    "    - Describe what should appear and let the framework handle the how\n",
    "- **Imperative DOM updates**:\n",
    "    - Manually creating and modifying DOM elements, you describe what should appear and let the framework handle the how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Cleaner code\n",
    "- Better scalability\n",
    "- Consistency in updates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reactivity\n",
    "Reactivity is the ability for the UI to automatically update in response to changes in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte, you bind data to your views.\n",
    "- When that data changes, the framework updates the UI.\n",
    "    - This avoids manual DOM querying and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of data binding:\n",
    "- **One-way (React)**\n",
    "- Two-way (Angular, Vue)\n",
    "    - This is a key concept because it keeps the state and UI in sync without direct DOM access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Management\n",
    "All frameworks provide a way to manage state — the data your app relies on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of state:\n",
    "- Local state: Within a component\n",
    "- Global state: Shared across components\n",
    "\n",
    "Common state management solutions:\n",
    "- Redux (React)\n",
    "- Zustand (React)\n",
    "- Vuex / Pinia (Vue)\n",
    "- Svelte store\n",
    "\n",
    "State should ideally be:\n",
    "- Abstracted from the DOM\n",
    "- Easy to test\n",
    "- Easy to update predictably\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation and Testability\n",
    "Frameworks enforce modular design principles. Each component is self-contained, making it easy to:\n",
    "- Reuse across different views\n",
    "- Write unit tests\n",
    "- Maintain and refactor\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Prevents changes in one part from affecting others\n",
    "- Encourages readable and scalable code\n",
    "- Makes code more predictable and easier to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declarative Data Flow\n",
    "In declarative frameworks, you express what the UI should look like based on state. The framework handles the actual rendering logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contrasts with imperative code where developers must manually manage DOM nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Declarative code is:\n",
    "- Easier to read\n",
    "- More predictable\n",
    "- Less error-prone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Store Pattern (optional)\n",
    "Some frameworks or ecosystems use a store pattern to manage global state. This avoids the need to pass data deeply through many components (known as \"prop drilling\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Vue: Vuex, Pinia\n",
    "- React: Zustand, Redux\n",
    "- Svelte: Built-in store\n",
    "\n",
    "Use global stores for:\n",
    "- Auth status\n",
    "- Theme settings\n",
    "- User preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid global stores for:\n",
    "- Temporary or input state\n",
    "- Data used only within one component\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Injection (optional)\n",
    "Dependency Injection (DI) lets you provide parts of your app (e.g., services, APIs) at runtime.\n",
    "- Angular has a built-in DI system.\n",
    "- React uses the Context API.\n",
    "- Vue offers provide/inject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "- Testing (injecting mocks)\n",
    "- Environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev vs. production)\n",
    "- Replacing implementations without rewriting app logic\n",
    "\n",
    "# React in the Modern Web\n",
    "- What React is, why it exists,\n",
    "- How it differs from other tools in the web development ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Libraries vs. Frameworks**\n",
    "- **Library**: \n",
    "    - A collection of reusable code that gives you tools to solve specific problems. \n",
    "    - You stay in control of the flow (e.g., React, jQuery).\n",
    "- **Framework**: \n",
    "    - An opinionated system that dictates how your app should be structured. \n",
    "    - The framework is in control (e.g., Angular, Next.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Libraries give you tools; frameworks give you structure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "React defines itself as a library, but with its ecosystem (React Router, Redux, etc.), it often behaves like a framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "React helped shift the web from monolithic HTML/CSS/JS files to modular, reactive components.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Use React?\n",
    "React is favored by developers and employers for several reasons:\n",
    "- Declarative syntax: Tell React what you want, not how to do it.\n",
    "- Component-based: Break your UI into independent, reusable pieces.\n",
    "- Ecosystem: Massive library support and a large, active community.\n",
    "- Job demand: React consistently ranks as one of the most in-demand skills in front-end development.\n",
    "- Community: Discords, subreddits, and open source packages make learning and problem-solving easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When You Might Not Need React\n",
    "React is powerful, but not always necessary. Avoid it if:\n",
    "- You're building a simple, one-page landing site.\n",
    "- You want minimal bundle size and fastest loading time (especially on poor networks).\n",
    "- You’re working on a legacy codebase incompatible with modern frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "React comes with a learning curve and setup complexity — it’s best used when you need its power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### React’s Core Philosophies\n",
    "**Composability**\n",

    "    - Props are a mechanism for a parent component to pass data to its child components.\n",

    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Read-Only: \n",
    "    - A component can never modify its own props. \n",
    "    - They are immutable. \n",
    "        - Think of them like arguments to a function—the function uses them but doesn't change them.\n",
    "- One-Way Data Flow: \n",
    "    - Data is passed from parent to child, never the other way around. \n",
    "    - This makes the data flow predictable and easier to debug.\n",
    "- Any Data Type: \n",
    "    - Props can be \n",
    "        - strings, \n",
    "        - numbers, \n",
    "        - booleans, \n",

    "## Controlled Components and Forms\n",
    "Forms are essential to most web applications — whether:\n",
    "- collecting user input, \n",
    "- submitting contact messages,\n",
    "- searching a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "In React, **input elements** like text fields are managed using **controlled components**, \n",
    "- where the input’s value is tied to component state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Controlled Components?**\n",
    "- In HTML, form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` maintain their own state. \n",
    "- In React, mutable state is kept in the state property of components and only updated with `setState()`(or the useState hook).\n",
    "    - A Controlled Component is a form element whose value is controlled by React state. \n",
    "    - Instead of the DOM managing the value, React state becomes the \"single source of truth.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Controlled Components?**\n",
    "- Immediate Validation: You can validate input on every keystroke.\n",
    "- Conditional Disabling: You can enable/disable the submit button based on the form's validity.\n",
    "- Enforced Input Formatting: You can force input to follow a specific format (e.g., phone numbers, credit cards).\n",
    "- Integration with UI: You can easily change other parts of your UI based on the form data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to build/Create controlled form inputs (Controlled Components)**\n",
    "The Data Flow - Pattern is always the same for every form element:\n",
    "1. Create a state variable to hold the value.\n",
    "    - The **component's state defines the current value of the input**.\n",
    "2. Set the element's value (or checked for checkboxes) prop to the state variable.\n",
    "    - The input's value attribute is set to that state value.\n",
    "3. Provide an onChange handler that updates the state using the event (e.target.value).\n",
    "    - When the user types, an onChange event handler fires.\n",
    "    - The handler updates the state with the new value (setState or set function).\n",
    "    - The component re-renders, and the input displays the new state value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a tight loop: \n",
    "- State \n",
    "- Input \n",
    "- Event \n",
    "- Update State \n",
    "- Re-render\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Controlled Inputs with value and onChange**\n",
    "In React, a **controlled component** is an **input element** whose value is controlled by React state.\n",
    "- The `value prop` ensures the input always shows the current state.\n",
    "- The `onChange` handler updates state when the user types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this, React cannot control the input — which is why uncontrolled inputs are generally avoided."
