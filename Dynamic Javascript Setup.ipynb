    "# Understanding Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction: Cornerstone of creating efficient and manageable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction\n",
    "- is about managing the complexity of systems by focusing on the high-level operations while hiding the details of their implementation. \n",
    "    - It's akin to knowing how to drive a car without needing to understand the intricacies of how the engine works. \n",
    "- In programming, abstraction allows us to use \n",
    "    - functions, \n",
    "    - variables, and \n",
    "    - other constructs without delving into their underlying details every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is a technique for managing complexity in software systems. \n",
    "- It allows developers to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts. Does it by:\n",
    "    - Focusing on the essential features of a component while \n",
    "    - Ignoring its complex details, \n",
    "- It helps in reducing complexity and making the software easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "- It is simplification\n",
    "    - hiding of complex details and presenting of a simple interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Abstraction Important?\n",
    "- Simplifies Complex Systems: \n",
    "    - By breaking down a system into manageable parts, abstraction makes it easier to focus on what each part does, rather than how it does it.\n",
    "- Reduces Code Complexity: \n",
    "    - It helps in hiding the detailed implementation of features, making the code cleaner and more understandable.\n",
    "- Enhances Code Reusability: \n",
    "    - Abstracted components can be reused in different parts of a software system or even in different projects, saving time and effort.\n",
    "- Improves Software Design: \n",
    "    - Good abstraction facilitates better software design, making it easier to modify and extend the software without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Abstraction in Everyday Life\n",
    "- Mathematics: Concepts like (E = mc^2) abstract complex relationships into comprehensible expressions.\n",
    "- Reading: Our ability to recognize words without spelling them out letter by letter is a form of abstraction, simplifying the process of reading.\n",
    "- Chunking: This psychological phenomenon demonstrates how we group information into manageable units, facilitating understanding and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Abstraction in Programming\n",
    "Focus on how to apply abstraction in building our programming projects. This involves:\n",
    "- Recognizing Patterns: Identifying common patterns that can be abstracted into functions or modules.\n",
    "- Building Reusable Components: Creating components that can be used across different parts of a project or even in different projects.\n",
    "- Simplifying Complexity: Using abstraction to simplify complex operations into more manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points (Video):\n",
    "**How to Design Software**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction in Practice**: \n",
    "- From basic principles to\n",
    "    - Transition from understanding individual concepts\n",
    "- How software is designed, \n",
    "    - see how to combine learned principles into **composable units**.\n",
    "    - to applying them in designing complex software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Managing Complexity**: \n",
    "- Complexity in software development lies in managing the space between **low-level elements/operations**, below the software level/system as a whole. \n",
    "- Effective abstraction helps in bridging this gap by creating manageable layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Application**:\n",
    "- Focus on individual concepts to help you building real-world applications. \n",
    "    - This dual approach helps in solidifying your understanding of JavaScript and programming fundamentals through practical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Importance of Fundamentals**: \n",
    "- Grasp the fundamentals is crucial before delving into abstraction.\n",
    "- How to approach and have a solid low-level foundation for abstraction:\n",
    "    - You can explain the Event Loop and why Promise callbacks run before setTimeout callbacks.\n",
    "    - You can predict the value of this in any given function without running the code.\n",
    "    - You can implement data privacy and function factories using closures.\n",
    "    - You can create an inheritance chain without the class keyword.\n",
    "    - You can convert between callbacks, promises, and async/await fluently.\n",
    "    - You can debug a \"cannot read property X of undefined\" error by understanding the prototype chain.\n",
    "- How to Approach These High-Level Concepts for abstraction:\n",
    "    - Build a Project: The best way to learn these is to build a medium-sized project (e.g., a todo app is fine, but try something more complex like a small e-commerce site or a social media post feed).\n",
    "    - Use a Framework: Choose React (most popular, great ecosystem) or Vue (excellent documentation, very approachable) and build with it.\n",
    "    - Encounter Problems: You will run into state management problems—this is when you learn Redux or Zustand. You will run into prop drilling—this is when you learn the Context API.\n",
    "    - Add Tooling: Set up ESLint and Prettier. Use Vite to create your project. Later, add TypeScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low-level Foundations: Gives you the power to understand JavaScript.\n",
    "- Move from thinking: \"this line runs, then that line runs\"\n",
    "- To thinking: Environment where it runs.\n",
    "    - **JavaScript Engine** (e.g., V8) - Understand it has a:\n",

    "                - Syntactic sugar built on top of promises. \n",
    "                - Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code. \n",
    "                - Understand that `await` keyword simply pauses the execution of the `async` function, not the whole program.\n",
    "            - What to practice:\n",
    "                - Convert a callback-based function (like `fs.readFile`) into a promise-based one.\n",
    "                - Chain multiple promises together to perform sequential async operations.\n",
    "                - Use `async/await` to rewrite promise chains for cleaner syntax.\n",

    "- basics of JavaScript, \n",
    "- debugging, \n",
    "- code style,\n",
    "- managing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications of Abstraction\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Creating a unique identifier (UUID) in JavaScript. \n",
    "    - At its core, the process involves complex operations,\n",
    "        - Through abstraction, we encapsulate this complexity into a single function. \n",
    "        - This function, `createUniqueID()`, can then be used without needing to understand its internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual Functions Abstraction in Layers\n",
    "- From UUIDs to Employees:\n",
    "    - Extend our abstraction example to creating employees in a system. \n",
    "        - By abstracting the process, `createUniqueID()`, into a `createEmployee()` function, we define what information is essential and hide the rest.\n",
    "        - This method not only makes the code cleaner but also ensures consistency across the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "System-Wide Abstraction\n",
    "- Abstract at the system level allows defining entities like colleagues or event attendees in terms of their relationships and interactions. \n",
    "    - This higher level of abstraction allows us to model complex systems in a way that is intuitive and easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks of Over-Abstraction\n",
    "- Abstraction is powerful, it's important to use it judiciously. \n",
    "- Over-abstraction can lead to code that is difficult to understand or modify, \n",
    "    - as the connections between the abstracted concepts become too tenuous or obscured. \n",
    "- Finding the right balance is key to effective software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different programming paradigms that leverage abstraction,\n",
    "- Procedural Programming: Building on what we've been doing, focusing on sequences of actions or steps.\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulating data and operations into objects, a common approach for managing complexity in large applications.\n",
    "- Functional Programming: Emphasizing the use of functions as the primary building blocks of software.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Each paradigm offers a unique approach to abstraction, with its own set of advantages and potential pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction Significance\n",
    "- Abstraction: Cognitive process, which simplify complex things into more manageable \"things\" or concepts.\n",
    "    - How one can instinctively recognise an object without examining every part in detail\n",
    "- In programming, effective software development requires us to abstract our code into components with specific properties and functionalities.\n",
    "    - helps manage complexity by focusing on the essence of what these components do, rather than how they do it.\n",
    "    - enables developers to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable ones, constructing components that solve these smaller issues and then combining them into a complete application. \n",
    "    - helps us structure our code according to our built-in human ability to think, reason and interact with complex things without having to understand all the parts that make a thing.\n",
    "- Abstraction and the brain:\n",
    "    - The brains automatically take a group of related low-level complex parts and group them into simpler “things”,\n",
    "    - The brain instinctively “knows” what something is without having to inspect every element it is made from in detail until you can conclude, “I think this is maybe a door”.\n",
    "    - The ability for the brain to instinctively think and talk about “objects”, whether in programming or real life.\n",
    "- As a programmer: The ability to meaningfully abstract code is what separates bad software developers from good software developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of Abstraction in Software Design\n",
    "Abstraction is about\n",
    "- simplification; \n",
    "- identifying and focusing on the essential characteristics of a component while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is critical in creating **scalable** and **maintainable software**. \n",
    "- The ability to abstract effectively separates great developers from the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SOLID Principles\n",
    "Abstraction allows developers to manage complexity by hiding the detailed implementation of a feature, making the code more flexible, maintainable, and reusable. \n",
    "- Explore how to create effective abstractions in JavaScript by applying the SOLID principles. \n",
    "    - SOLID is a set of guidelines for object-oriented programming that promotes good software design and architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID stands for: \n",

    "### What makes a good Abstraction\n",
    "- Through guidelines, \n",
    "    - Three different paradigms that have their own opinion on how abstraction should be done in software.\n",

    "    - set of guidelines for object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. \n",
    "- To apply SRP in JavaScript,\n",
    "    - Create separate modules or classes that handle specific tasks or responsibilities. \n",
    "    - Each module or class should be responsible for a single functionality or feature, and should not be coupled with other functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. \n",
    "- In JavaScript,\n",
    "    - Apply this principle by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods or properties. \n",
    "        - Concrete classes can then inherit from these abstract classes or interfaces and implement their methods. \n",
    "            - This way, you can add new functionalities without modifying existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - implement LSP by ensuring that subclasses inherit all the properties and methods of their superclass, and do not alter their behaviour in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that a client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - Apply ISP by creating small, focused interfaces that define only the methods that a client needs. \n",
    "        - This way, you can avoid creating large, bloated interfaces that are difficult to maintain and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. \n",
    "    - Instead, both should depend on abstractions. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - Implement DIP by using dependency injection, which allows you to pass dependencies to a module or class rather than creating them inside. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n",
    "- Definition: A class or module should have only one reason to change.\n",
    "- In JavaScript: Implement SRP by creating separate modules or classes for different functionalities. Ensure each module or class handles a single aspect of the application. For example, if you have a module for managing user data, it should not include functions for handling user interface (UI) elements.\n",

    "##### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n",
    "- Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",

    "- It give you interfaces (button), which then allow you to then interact with each other and classes cannot interect with other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts (The Four Pillars):\n",
    "- `Encapsulation`: Bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). Internal state is often hidden (\"private\"), and interaction happens through a public interface.\n",
    "- `Abstraction`: Exposing only essential features and hiding complex implementation details. (e.g., You know a Car has a start() method, but you don't need to know about the ignition system).\n",
    "- `Inheritance`: Allowing a new class (child) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (parent). This promotes code reusability and establishes \"is-a\" relationships.\n",
    "- `Polymorphism`: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. A method call will behave differently based on the object that is acting. (e.g., Shape class with a draw() method; Circle.draw() and Square.draw() do different things).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Literals and Factory Functions\n",
    "- Object literals are a straightforward way to create objects.\n",
    "- Factory functions are functions that return new objects. \n",
    "    - These can be used to create multiple instances of similar objects, making them ideal for tasks in our to-do list application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts in OOP\n",
    "- Classes vs. Factory Functions: While JavaScript supports classes, focus on **factory functions** for simplicity. \n",
    "    - Factory functions provide a more straightforward approach to creating objects without the complexity of classes.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Demonstrated by grouping related data and functions together into objects, making the code cleaner and more modular.\n",
    " \n",
    "Advantages of OOP\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Allows for bundling data with methods that operate on that data.\n",
    "- Reusability: Through the use of objects, code can be reused, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "- Scalability: OOP makes it easier to scale and manage larger applications by breaking down complex problems into manageable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The OOP paradym dying down: Used to be the main mode\n",
    "- Recendly code became more concurrent and decentralised\n",
    "    - Software used to be close to where the data is.\n",
    "    - Install it in the computer and it would live there.\n",

    "- Problem: If one small part (e.g., the password reset feature) has a bug that crashes the program, the entire application goes down.\n",
    "- Problem: To scale because photos are using too much storage, you have to scale the entire application, even the parts that don't need it.\n",
    "- Problem: Every team of developers works on the same codebase, leading to complicated coordination and a high risk of breaking someone else's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microservices are the architectural antithesis of this. \n",
    "- Instead of one giant application, you build many small, independent services that work together.\n",

    "|Data Decentralization (Data Sovereignty)|\tThis is the most important form of decentralization. Each service owns and manages its own private database. Other services cannot access this database directly. They can only ask the service for data via its API.|\tThe \"Photo Service\" has its own database (e.g., AWS S3) where it stores the actual image files and their metadata (filename, upload time, etc.). The \"User Profile Service\" cannot directly read from the photo database. To get a user's photos, it must make a request to the Photo Service's API.|\n",
    "|Technology Decentralization |\tEach service can be written in a different programming language, use a different framework, and use the type of database that is best suited for its specific job.|\tThe \"Identity Service\" might be written in Java with a strong security framework and use a relational SQL database (like PostgreSQL) for strict data integrity of user credentials.  The \"Analytics Service\" might be written in Python for data science and use a columnar database (like Cassandra) optimized for fast writes and large queries. |\n",
    "|Decision-Making Decentralization|\tDevelopment teams are organized around services (\"You own the Identity service\"). They can make decisions independently—choosing their own tools, deployment schedules, and development methodologies—as long as they adhere to the shared API contracts.|\tThe Identity team can upgrade their library without needing to check with the Photo team. This enables teams to move much faster and innovate independently.|\n",

    "2. The \"Web Server\" receives your request and sees you need to be authenticated.\n",
    "3. It concurrently makes a network call to the \"Identity Service\" saying, \"Is this user's token valid?\"\n",
    "4. It waits for a response before proceeding.|\n",
    "|Handling Many Requests|\tEach service is designed to handle many requests at the same time. A single instance of the Photo Service might be serving download requests to thousands of users simultaneously.|\tThe \"Photo Service\" can have multiple copies (or replicas) running behind a load balancer. When millions of users request their photos, the load balancer distributes these requests across all the available replicas, allowing the work to be done concurrently and at a massive scale.|\n",
    "|Resilience Through Concurrency|\tThe failure of one service does not have to mean the failure of others. The system is designed to handle these failures gracefully (e.g., using timeouts and fallbacks).|\tIf the \"Identity Service\" is slow or crashes, the \"Web Server\" should \"time out\" after a few seconds and return a helpful error message like \"Authentication service unavailable,\" instead of freezing forever. The rest of the system (e.g., services not needing auth) remains up.|\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Request: The app (the client) sends a request: \"Get the profile page data for user @tom.\"\n",
    "2. API Gateway: The request hits an API Gateway (a traffic cop). It routes the request to the \"Profile Page Service\".\n",
    "3. Orchestration (Concurrency): The Profile Page Service doesn't have the data itself. It orchestrates by making multiple concurrent network calls to other services:\n",
    "    - It calls the \"Identity Service\": \"Confirm the requesting user has permission to view this profile.\" (This happens in the background).\n",
    "    - It calls the \"User Service\": \"Get the basic profile info for @tom (name, bio, etc.).\"\n",

    "    - Owns its data: The User Service has its own \"User\" database. The Photo Service has its own \"Photo\" storage.\n",
    "    - Processes the request: They perform their specific logic and return only the necessary data (e.g., JSON) to the Profile Page Service.\n",

    "- System with OOP overhead would be idle\n",
    "- But with Functional programming, Things can still happen while you wait for data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Functional Programming (FP)**\n",
    "FP treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes what to solve rather than how to solve it (declarative style).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.\n",

    "- Its says dont create abstractions where themselves are mutable (dont create objects where values can change with OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "- `Pure Functions`: Functions that, given the same input, will always return the same output and have no side effects (e.g., no modifying global variables, no printing to console).\n",
    "- `Immutability`: Data is immutable; it cannot be changed after it's created. Instead of changing existing data, you create new data.\n",
    "- `First-Class and Higher-Order Functions`: Functions are treated like any other variable. They can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values, and assigned to variables. A function that takes another function as an argument is a higher-order function (e.g., map, filter, reduce).\n",
    "- `Avoidance of Side Effects`: A side effect is any change outside the function's scope (modifying a global variable, writing to a file, etc.). FP strives to minimize these.\n",
    "- `Recursion`: Used heavily for iteration and control flow, as opposed to traditional loops which often require state change (e.g., incrementing a counter).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison and Practical Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural vs. Object-Oriented:\n",
    "- Procedural programming can be simpler and more straightforward for linear processes.\n",
    "- OOP is more suitable for complex applications with lots of interconnected parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented vs. Functional:\n",
    "- OOP is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.\n",
    "- Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of functions without side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming in Modern JavaScript:\n",
    "- Even though JavaScript supports OOP, there's a growing trend towards functional programming due to its simplicity and the immutability of data.\n",
    "- JavaScript, being a multi-paradigm language, allows developers to blend elements from both OOP and functional programming."

    "# OOP - Object Orientated programming\n",
    "Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism within JavaScript.\n",
    "- These principles stand as fundamental pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP), and their application in JavaScript offers a rich landscape for learning and exploration.\n",
    "    - Encapsulation, think about how JavaScript objects bundle data and functions together. \n",
    "    - Inheritance, consider how objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. \n",
    "    - Polymorphism, reflect on how different objects can be treated as instances of a single type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think critically about how the concepts being explained could be applied to your own projects or problems you're interested in solving.\n",
    "- Focus on the \"why\" and \"how\" of the concepts illustrated by the project code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Encapsulation**\n",
    "In OOP, encapsulation is central to creating abstractions.\n",
    "- Abstractions help in solving specific programming problems by allowing us to \n",
    "    - bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (object)\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is at the heart of OOP since it allows grouping of related data and behaviour behind an abstracted interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts, the others being:\n",
    "- inheritance, \n",
    "- polymorphism, and \n",
    "- abstraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the **bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within one unit**, and restricting access to some of the object's components. \n",
    "- AKA: a class in Java or \n",
    "- AKA: a prototype in JavaScript\n",
    "    - This means that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside, only exposing a controlled interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Achieve Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Using Classes: Most OOP languages use classes to encapsulate data and methods. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects (instances).\n",
    "- Access Modifiers: Keywords like `private`, `protected`, and `public` in languages such as Java and C++ control access to the object's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript, being a prototype-based language, has a slightly different approach to OOP.\n",
    "- It is a `syntactical sugar` over its existing prototype-based inheritance.\n",
    "    - making changes or additions to the syntax of a language that don't add new features but make things easier to write or read.\n",
    "    - meaning, classes provide a clearer and more straightforward way to set up inheritance.\n",
    "        - they make the code look cleaner and more like how other programming languages handle object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "        - but underneath, JavaScript still uses its original prototype-based system to make it all work.\n",
    "- Objects inherit features and properties from one another through a system known as \"prototype-based inheritance.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Before: JavaScript used prototypes directly for inheritance. \n",
    "- This means that objects can have a prototype object, which they can inherit properties and methods from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation in web development involves creating components with private internal states that can only be interacted with through a public interface.\n",
    "- This ensures the component's internal workings are hidden, safeguarding from external changes unless through specified methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating Components with Private States\n",
    "    - Encapsulation in web components involves defining properties and methods that are only accessible within the component. \n",
    "    - This can be achieved using \n",
    "        - `closures`, \n",
    "        - `classes`,\n",
    "        - `Web Components standards` which use the **Shadow DOM**\n",
    "2. Web Components and Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Web Components provide a standard way to create encapsulated, reusable custom elements. \n",
    "    - These components encapsulate their \n",
    "        - HTML structure, \n",
    "        - CSS styles, and \n",
    "        - JavaScript functionality, \n",
    "            - preventing external interference and clashes with other parts of a web application.\n",
    "3. Using Classes for Encapsulation\n",
    "    - JavaScript classes offer a more traditional OOP approach to encapsulation. \n",
    "    - By using classes, developers can define private properties and methods that are not accessible from outside the class instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation\n",
    "- Is the bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (object). \n",
    "- It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental modification of data.\n",
    "- This concept helps in maintaining code by:\n",
    "    - Hiding the internal state: Only necessary information is exposed, reducing complexity.\n",
    "    - Reducing interdependencies: Changes in one part of the system minimally affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Factory Function**\n",
    "A factory function is a way to create objects. It can encapsulate and return an object with methods and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Getters and Setters**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Classes and Prototypes**\n",

    "- Built-in prototypal chaining on which JavaScript classes are built.\n",
    "- How prototypes are used in the JavaScript DOM and utilise this functionality to extend the HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to interact with that data. It simplifies the creation of objects and managing inheritance.\n",

    "##### Prototypal Inheritance Versus Classical Inheritance\n",
    "JavaScript utilises **prototypal inheritance**, \n",
    "- differs from classical inheritance found in languages like Java or C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "In prototypal inheritance:\n",
    "- Objects inherit from other objects directly.\n",
    "- It allows for more flexible and dynamic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Prototypal Inheritance?**\n",
    "- Prototypal inheritance is a feature of JavaScript and other similar languages. \n",
    "- It operates on the principle that objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects. \n",
    "- Here are the key characteristics:\n",
    "    - Direct Inheritance: Objects can directly inherit from other objects. There is no need for classes as a middleman.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Relationships: Because objects inherit directly from other objects, you can create and modify inheritance relationships at runtime, making it very flexible.\n",
    "    - Simpler and More Flexible: Prototypal inheritance can be more straightforward to understand and use because it involves less boilerplate than classical inheritance systems.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In classical inheritance:\n",
    "- This is more structured but can become rigid and complex, leading to difficulties in maintenance and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Classical Inheritance?**\n",
    "- Classical inheritance, is a model used by languages like Java, C++, and C#. \n",
    "- It's characterized by a more rigid, class-based structure. \n",
    "- Here's how it differs:\n",
    "    - Class-Based: Inheritance is defined through classes. A subclass inherits from a superclass, defining a clear hierarchy.\n",
    "    - Static Structure: The inheritance relationships are defined at compile time and cannot be changed at runtime. This leads to a more predictable structure but reduces flexibility.\n",
    "    - Complexity with Deep Hierarchies: As projects grow and hierarchies deepen, classical inheritance can become complex, making it harder to manage and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How objects or classes share properties and methods\n",
    "Two primary models of inheritance help facilitate this: \n",
    "- Prototypal inheritance \n",
    "- Classical inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Differences between these two models\n",
    "- Implementation in JavaScript (for prototypal inheritance) \n",

    "- Extending HTML Elements: By extending the HTMLElement class, custom elements can inherit properties and methods from it, allowing them to behave like standard HTML elements.\n",
    "- Constructor and Super: The constructor method is a special method for creating and initialising an object created with a class. Calling super() within it is crucial as it calls the constructor of the parent class (HTMLElement in this case), ensuring the custom element has all the necessary initialisation from its HTML element lineage.\n",

    "        - title,\n",
    "        - completed\n",

    " \n",
    "##### **Shadow DOM**\n",
    "- Provides encapsulation for web components, keeping the component's internal features separate from the main document DOM. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Shadow DOM\n",
    "1. Attach Shadow DOM to Element: \n",
    "    - Use `element.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })` to attach a shadow root to the custom element. \n",
    "        - The mode can be 'open' or 'closed'.\n",
    "2. Add Content to Shadow DOM: \n",

    "4. Subscribing to the Store: \n",
    "    - This involves creating a mechanism where parts of your application can \"listen\" to changes in the store.\n",
    "    - When the state changes, the store notifies all subscribers of the new state, allowing them to react accordingly.\n",
    "5. Middleware: In more advanced scenarios, you might introduce middleware into your store. \n",
    "    - Middleware are functions that get executed in the process of updating the state, allowing for additional logic such as logging or persisting state changes.\n"
