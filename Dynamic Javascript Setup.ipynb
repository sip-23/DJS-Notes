    "# Understanding Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction: Cornerstone of creating efficient and manageable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction\n",
    "- is about managing the complexity of systems by focusing on the high-level operations while hiding the details of their implementation. \n",
    "    - It's akin to knowing how to drive a car without needing to understand the intricacies of how the engine works. \n",
    "- In programming, abstraction allows us to use \n",
    "    - functions, \n",
    "    - variables, and \n",
    "    - other constructs without delving into their underlying details every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is a technique for managing complexity in software systems. \n",
    "- It allows developers to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts. Does it by:\n",
    "    - Focusing on the essential features of a component while \n",
    "    - Ignoring its complex details, \n",
    "- It helps in reducing complexity and making the software easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "- It is simplification\n",
    "    - hiding of complex details and presenting of a simple interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Abstraction Important?\n",
    "- Simplifies Complex Systems: \n",
    "    - By breaking down a system into manageable parts, abstraction makes it easier to focus on what each part does, rather than how it does it.\n",
    "- Reduces Code Complexity: \n",
    "    - It helps in hiding the detailed implementation of features, making the code cleaner and more understandable.\n",
    "- Enhances Code Reusability: \n",
    "    - Abstracted components can be reused in different parts of a software system or even in different projects, saving time and effort.\n",
    "- Improves Software Design: \n",
    "    - Good abstraction facilitates better software design, making it easier to modify and extend the software without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Abstraction in Everyday Life\n",
    "- Mathematics: Concepts like (E = mc^2) abstract complex relationships into comprehensible expressions.\n",
    "- Reading: Our ability to recognize words without spelling them out letter by letter is a form of abstraction, simplifying the process of reading.\n",
    "- Chunking: This psychological phenomenon demonstrates how we group information into manageable units, facilitating understanding and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Abstraction in Programming\n",
    "Focus on how to apply abstraction in building our programming projects. This involves:\n",
    "- Recognizing Patterns: Identifying common patterns that can be abstracted into functions or modules.\n",
    "- Building Reusable Components: Creating components that can be used across different parts of a project or even in different projects.\n",
    "- Simplifying Complexity: Using abstraction to simplify complex operations into more manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points (Video):\n",
    "**How to Design Software**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction in Practice**: \n",
    "- From basic principles to\n",
    "    - Transition from understanding individual concepts\n",
    "- How software is designed, \n",
    "    - see how to combine learned principles into **composable units**.\n",
    "    - to applying them in designing complex software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Managing Complexity**: \n",
    "- Complexity in software development lies in managing the space between **low-level elements/operations**, below the software level/system as a whole. \n",
    "- Effective abstraction helps in bridging this gap by creating manageable layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Application**:\n",
    "- Focus on individual concepts to help you building real-world applications. \n",
    "    - This dual approach helps in solidifying your understanding of JavaScript and programming fundamentals through practical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Importance of Fundamentals**: \n",
    "- Grasp the fundamentals is crucial before delving into abstraction.\n",
    "- How to approach and have a solid low-level foundation for abstraction:\n",
    "    - You can explain the Event Loop and why Promise callbacks run before setTimeout callbacks.\n",
    "    - You can predict the value of this in any given function without running the code.\n",
    "    - You can implement data privacy and function factories using closures.\n",
    "    - You can create an inheritance chain without the class keyword.\n",
    "    - You can convert between callbacks, promises, and async/await fluently.\n",
    "    - You can debug a \"cannot read property X of undefined\" error by understanding the prototype chain.\n",
    "- How to Approach These High-Level Concepts for abstraction:\n",
    "    - Build a Project: The best way to learn these is to build a medium-sized project (e.g., a todo app is fine, but try something more complex like a small e-commerce site or a social media post feed).\n",
    "    - Use a Framework: Choose React (most popular, great ecosystem) or Vue (excellent documentation, very approachable) and build with it.\n",
    "    - Encounter Problems: You will run into state management problems—this is when you learn Redux or Zustand. You will run into prop drilling—this is when you learn the Context API.\n",
    "    - Add Tooling: Set up ESLint and Prettier. Use Vite to create your project. Later, add TypeScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low-level Foundations: Gives you the power to understand JavaScript.\n",
    "- Move from thinking: \"this line runs, then that line runs\"\n",
    "- To thinking: Environment where it runs.\n",
    "    - **JavaScript Engine** (e.g., V8) - Understand it has a:\n",

    "                - Syntactic sugar built on top of promises. \n",
    "                - Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code. \n",
    "                - Understand that `await` keyword simply pauses the execution of the `async` function, not the whole program.\n",
    "            - What to practice:\n",
    "                - Convert a callback-based function (like `fs.readFile`) into a promise-based one.\n",
    "                - Chain multiple promises together to perform sequential async operations.\n",
    "                - Use `async/await` to rewrite promise chains for cleaner syntax.\n",

    "It's important to have a solid foundation in the:\n",
    "- basics of JavaScript, \n",
    "- debugging, \n",
    "- code style,\n",
    "- managing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications of Abstraction\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Creating a unique identifier (UUID) in JavaScript. \n",
    "    - At its core, the process involves complex operations,\n",
    "        - Through abstraction, we encapsulate this complexity into a single function. \n",
    "        - This function, `createUniqueID()`, can then be used without needing to understand its internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual Functions Abstraction in Layers\n",
    "- From UUIDs to Employees:\n",
    "    - Extend our abstraction example to creating employees in a system. \n",
    "        - By abstracting the process, `createUniqueID()`, into a `createEmployee()` function, we define what information is essential and hide the rest.\n",
    "        - This method not only makes the code cleaner but also ensures consistency across the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "System-Wide Abstraction\n",
    "- Abstract at the system level allows defining entities like colleagues or event attendees in terms of their relationships and interactions. \n",
    "    - This higher level of abstraction allows us to model complex systems in a way that is intuitive and easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks of Over-Abstraction\n",
    "- Abstraction is powerful, it's important to use it judiciously. \n",
    "- Over-abstraction can lead to code that is difficult to understand or modify, \n",
    "    - as the connections between the abstracted concepts become too tenuous or obscured. \n",
    "- Finding the right balance is key to effective software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different programming paradigms that leverage abstraction,\n",
    "- Procedural Programming: Building on what we've been doing, focusing on sequences of actions or steps.\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulating data and operations into objects, a common approach for managing complexity in large applications.\n",
    "- Functional Programming: Emphasizing the use of functions as the primary building blocks of software.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Each paradigm offers a unique approach to abstraction, with its own set of advantages and potential pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction Significance\n",
    "- Abstraction: Cognitive process, which simplify complex things into more manageable \"things\" or concepts.\n",
    "    - How one can instinctively recognise an object without examining every part in detail\n",
    "- In programming, effective software development requires us to abstract our code into components with specific properties and functionalities.\n",
    "    - helps manage complexity by focusing on the essence of what these components do, rather than how they do it.\n",
    "    - enables developers to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable ones, constructing components that solve these smaller issues and then combining them into a complete application. \n",
    "    - helps us structure our code according to our built-in human ability to think, reason and interact with complex things without having to understand all the parts that make a thing.\n",
    "- Abstraction and the brain:\n",
    "    - The brains automatically take a group of related low-level complex parts and group them into simpler “things”,\n",
    "    - The brain instinctively “knows” what something is without having to inspect every element it is made from in detail until you can conclude, “I think this is maybe a door”.\n",
    "    - The ability for the brain to instinctively think and talk about “objects”, whether in programming or real life.\n",
    "- As a programmer: The ability to meaningfully abstract code is what separates bad software developers from good software developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of Abstraction in Software Design\n",
    "Abstraction is about\n",
    "- simplification; \n",
    "- identifying and focusing on the essential characteristics of a component while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is critical in creating **scalable** and **maintainable software**. \n",
    "- The ability to abstract effectively separates great developers from the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SOLID Principles\n",
    "Abstraction allows developers to manage complexity by hiding the detailed implementation of a feature, making the code more flexible, maintainable, and reusable. \n",
    "- Explore how to create effective abstractions in JavaScript by applying the SOLID principles. \n",
    "    - SOLID is a set of guidelines for object-oriented programming that promotes good software design and architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID stands for: \n",
    "- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), \n",
    "- Open-Closed Principle (OCP), \n",
    "- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), \n",
    "- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), \n",
    "- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these principles provide a framework for building software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes a good Abstraction\n",
    "- Through guidelines, \n",
    "    - Three different paradigms that have their own opinion on how abstraction should be done in software.\n",
    "- In JavaScript, Abstraction can be implemented using the **SOLID principles**, which are a \n",
    "    - set of guidelines for object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. \n",
    "- To apply SRP in JavaScript,\n",
    "    - Create separate modules or classes that handle specific tasks or responsibilities. \n",
    "    - Each module or class should be responsible for a single functionality or feature, and should not be coupled with other functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. \n",
    "- In JavaScript,\n",
    "    - Apply this principle by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods or properties. \n",
    "        - Concrete classes can then inherit from these abstract classes or interfaces and implement their methods. \n",
    "            - This way, you can add new functionalities without modifying existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - implement LSP by ensuring that subclasses inherit all the properties and methods of their superclass, and do not alter their behaviour in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that a client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - Apply ISP by creating small, focused interfaces that define only the methods that a client needs. \n",
    "        - This way, you can avoid creating large, bloated interfaces that are difficult to maintain and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: \n",
    "- This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. \n",
    "    - Instead, both should depend on abstractions. \n",
    "- In JavaScript, \n",
    "    - Implement DIP by using dependency injection, which allows you to pass dependencies to a module or class rather than creating them inside. \n",
    "        - This way, you can decouple modules and make them more reusable and testable.\n",

    "### Creating Abstraction with SOLID in JavaScript\n",
    "- How to implement abstraction in JavaScript and create more maintainable, flexible, and reusable code by following SOLID principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n",
    "- Definition: A class or module should have only one reason to change.\n",
    "- In JavaScript: Implement SRP by creating separate modules or classes for different functionalities. Ensure each module or class handles a single aspect of the application. For example, if you have a module for managing user data, it should not include functions for handling user interface (UI) elements.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**\n",
    "- Definition: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "- In JavaScript: Use abstract classes or interfaces to define the structure of a module. Then, extend these abstract classes with concrete classes that implement specific functionalities. This approach allows you to add new features without altering existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\n",
    "- Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.\n",
    "- In JavaScript: Ensure that subclasses can replace their superclass without changing the expected behavior. This means a subclass must inherit all properties and methods of its superclass and should not override them in a way that would break the functionality of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n",
    "- Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n",
    "- In JavaScript: Design small, focused interfaces that contain only the methods a client requires. Avoid large interfaces that compel the implementation of methods that are unnecessary for the client. This principle leads to a more modular and cohesive codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n",
    "- Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "- In JavaScript: Use dependency injection to achieve DIP. Pass dependencies to a module or class rather than hard-coding them within the module. This reduces coupling between modules, making the code more flexible and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Applying SOLID Principles in JavaScript**\n",
    "To apply these principles effectively, \n",
    "- Start by analyzing your application's requirements and design your classes and modules around these guidelines.\n",
    "    - The goal is to create software that is easy to maintain and extend over time.\n",
    "- For SRP, segregate your code into distinct classes or modules based on functionality.\n",
    "- Use inheritance and interfaces to apply OCP and LSP, ensuring that your codebase is flexible and scalable.\n",
    "- Adhere to ISP by creating interfaces that are client-specific rather than general-purpose.\n",
    "- Implement DIP through dependency injection to decouple your high-level and low-level modules."
